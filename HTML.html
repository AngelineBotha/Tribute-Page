    <h3 id="headline">Some information about Monty and his methods</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Monty Roberts Story</strong>
      <br>
      His father trained horses in the traditional way, 6000 years of methods handed down generationally, often violent and rarely fair to the horse. He expected Monty to follow in his footsteps and so Monty was also violently disciplined in the only way he knew how, through pain and force. Monty vowed to seek better methods for his own horses.
      <br>
      Monty first learned to listen to horses while observing wild mustangs in Nevada at the age of thirteen. Sent there to round up horses for the Salinas Rodeo Association’s Wild Horse Race, he spent hours silently watching the feral horses interact with each other.
      <li><strong>About Join-up</strong>
      <br>
       Join-Up is the title Monty Roberts has given to the body of his work with horses without violence. To define Join-Up, however, requires a narrower view of the term. Join-Up is that moment when the horse decides that it is better to be with the person than to go away. Join-Up can be achieved with all horses of any age or background. It is as effective on wild mustangs as it is on the gentle child’s horse.
      <li><strong>Join-Up as a Tool</strong>
      <br>
      Join-Up methods rely on horse and trainer establishing a bond of communication and trust. “You must somehow understand that we as horsemen can do very little to teach the horse. What we can do is to create an environment in which he can learn.” Monty says, “We hear that ‘actions speak louder than words,’ but generally we do not live by it too successfully.”
      <li><strong>The Movement</strong>
      <br>
      The Movement symposium was launched at Flag Is Up Farms in May 2018, with the vision to unite outstanding speakers and live demonstrations with horses. Founded on Monty Roberts’ belief that non-violent forms of communication are essential to building trust and achieving outstanding results, the mission of The Movement is to help people discover the unique power of horses to teach better ways to interact across all aspects of life.
      <li><strong>Animal Welfare</strong>
      <br>
      Monty Roberts famously said “My goal is to leave the world a better place than I found it, for horses and people too.” And part of Join-Up International’s mission is to assist horses in transition find new homes. Over the past 2 decades, through our Monty Roberts International Learning Center, we have been working with mustangs from the BLM (Bureau of Land Management), mustang rescue centers and horse rehabilitation networks to gentle and start horses in transition, to greatly improve their chances of being adopted or re-homed.
